Simple Entity Component System.

Entity Component System (ECS) architecture design has been rapidly advancing in the past decade,
especially in game development. Major commercial engines such as Unity and UnrealEngine implement ECS.

I have take this project as a learning exercise to catch basic idea behind internal structure of ECS.
As result, an optimized and efficient ECS engine is not my primary goal. Downsides of this project are
lack of custom memory managment and heavy use of C++ classes instead of efficient and cache-friendly
linear data structures and simple functions.
